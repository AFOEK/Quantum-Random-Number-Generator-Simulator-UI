This a GUI application build using Tkinter and Qiskit, which it will generate a random number from (n) H-gate,
it will created a random number using combination of (n) measured qubit with highest frequency.
All number bit string are stored into a list, after that converted into binary and finally converted into integer.

This project inspired by [this post](https://blog.red-badger.com/2018/9/24/generate-true-random-numbers-with-a-quantum-computer).
